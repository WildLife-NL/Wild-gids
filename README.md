# WildGids
WildlifeNL is a project led by an ambitious team of individuals working together to create a better life for the coexistence between humans and animals. As some of us know, many wild or free-roaming large mammals are returning to the Netherlands. In the 8-year WildlifeNL project (2023-2030), scientists are working together with social partners to investigate how people and wild animals can better coexist within the landscape.

The WildlifeNL project works in seven phases. They have currently reached the second phase of the entire project. In this phase, they need to gather the data required for research in the upcoming phases (or “work packages” as the organization calls them). They aim to collect the necessary data using two mobile apps, so they can analyze and use this information in the following phases for further research.

WildGids is one of the two apps that is mostly going to be used by the recreationist to help gather data from this specific user group.

## Flavors
We use flavors to manage different configurations for development, staging, and production environments. Flavors ensure that you can switch between environments without modifying the core app code.
- **Development:**
   ```bash
   flutter run --flavor development
   ```
- **Production:**
   ```bash
   flutter run --flavor production
   ```
To build APKs for specific environments:
```bash
flutter build apk --flavor production --release
```
